# Data Warehousing

In this lab, you will use PostgreSQL/mySQL Database. PostgreSQL/mySQL is a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) designed to efficiently store, manipulate, and retrieve data.

### Scenario

You are a data engineer hired by a solid waste management company. The company collects and recycles solid waste across major cities in the country of Brazil.

- total waste collected per year per city
- total waste collected per month per city
- total waste collected per quarter per city
- total waste collected per year per trucktype
- total waste collected per trucktype per city
- total waste collected per trucktype per station per city

You will use your data warehousing skills to design and implement a data warehouse for the company.
